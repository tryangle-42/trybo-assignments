# **Trybo Engineering Challenge: The Agentic Communication Bridge**

## **The Goal**

Build a functional prototype of a **human-in-the-loop agentic system**. You will create a mobile interface that triggers a backend "Agent" to perform a research task, stream its progress, and wait for your approval before "executing" the final action.

**Time Limit:** 24 Hours.
**Focus:** Backend/Frontend connectivity, Real-time state, and Error handling.

## **1. Technical Requirements**

### **A. Backend (Python/FastAPI)**

* **WebSocket Orchestrator:** Create a WebSocket endpoint `/v1/agent/connect`.
* **The Streaming Agent:** Simulate a "Research Agent" that sends a sequence of status updates to the mobile app (e.g., *"Searching for vendors..."*, *"Analyzing pricing..."*, *"Drafting outreach..."*).
* **The Consent Gate:** The backend must **pause** after drafting and wait for an `APPROVED` message from the mobile client over the socket before sending a "Task Success" final state.
* **Interrupt Handling:** If the user sends a `STOP` signal via the app, the backend must immediately terminate the process and return a "Cancelled" status.

### **B. Mobile Client (React Native)**

* **State Management:** Use **Zustand** or **TanStack Query** to track the agent’s progress and current status.
* **Streaming UI:** Build a chat-style interface that displays the agent's progress updates in real-time.
* **Optimistic UI:** When the task is triggered, the UI should immediately show a "Scheduled" state in a sidebar or task list, reflecting a `pending` status in the database schema.
* **Lifecycle Management:** Ensure that if the user backgrounds the app or navigates away, the socket is properly managed or cleaned up to prevent leaks.

### **C. AI Integration**

* **The Draft Tool:** Use any LLM (OpenAI, Gemini, or a mock wrapper) to generate the final message text based on the task description.
* **Self-Reflection:** Have the agent perform one "self-correction" step (e.g., the LLM checks its own draft for tone) before it asks for user approval.

## **2. Evaluation Metrics**

We aren't looking for a perfect UI; we are looking for a **Founding Engineer's** technical depth:

1. **Backend "Figure-it-out" Ability:** How well did you handle the state machine on the FastAPI server (handling pauses and approvals)?
2. **Attention to Detail:** Did you handle race conditions? What happens if the user hits "Stop" at the exact moment the agent finishes? 


3. **Independence:** Can you prioritize building the core "Bridge" over superficial styling?
4. **AI Leverage:** How effectively did you use LLM tools to build or enhance the feature?

## **3. Submission Instructions**

1. **Repository:** Provide a link to a private GitHub repo.
2. **Structure:** * `/backend`: FastAPI code.
* `/mobile`: React Native (Expo) code.


3. **Documentation:** A brief `README.md` explaining:
* How to run both services.
* How you handled the "Interrupt" logic.
* Any libraries you chose to speed up development (e.g., `react-native-gifted-chat` or `shadcn/ui` equivalents).

**Good luck, Asher. We are looking for high-agency engineers who can build for the future of agentic workflows.**
